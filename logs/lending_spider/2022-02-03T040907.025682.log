Things happen in life where you sometimes have no control over.

They gave links to various banks and then, I saw what First Midwest Bank was offering and pursued. I felt the process was fairly painless, even though my previous loan was easier. However, this loan provided to me was almost half the interest of the other service. So, I would rather deal with a few more hoops and hurdles and get a lower rate than going through a walk in the park and get a higher interest rate.

{'title': 'A Great Experience with an Unusual Situation. ', 'content': 'I contacted LendingTree and First Midwest Bank was one of the first institutions to respond. I had done business with them in the past. I had been looking for a personal loan to help with a business I am starting with a friend en Medellin Colombia, which is why the situation was unusual. I retired at the end of December and went to Medellin on a three year Visa for Retirees. I was not planning on starting a business. I have a young psychologist friend here who I have known for four years. She is quite intelligent and has a gift for working with kids. She outlined a plan to work with kids here to teach them Social Emotional Learning through music and art. I decided that it would be better to limit the number of outside investors and better to retain most of the control of the business. Because I was out of the country, there were many challenges to even getting the approval for the loan. I had a credit score in the 800\'s, but no assets since I sold everything when I moved here. I maintain a permanent address in the US. Simple things like calling to confirm my information became very complicated. My loan specialist, Jasmine, was with me every step of the way with what seemed like an incredible amount of patience with my seemingly endless questions that basically had the theme "how am I going to do this". We her help, we got it done. I am not sure how many other companies or their employees would have done the same. I highly recommend them and Jasmine.

At Midwest, I was informed they were working on it, and to expect a phone call later in the day with their decision. That afternoon I got a phone call informing me that my application had been denied, even though the referral from Lending Tree made it seem like the chances of approval were high. I have a 750  credit score, so I asked why I had been denied. They explained it was because my debt-to-income ratio was too high; I was applying for a debt consolidation loan after all.

I found First  Midwest Bank and begin to fill out the application. The next morning I received a phone call from Marcela Escutia, direct Sales Banker asking me a few questions about my application, she told me she would give the application to the underwriters for approval and get back to me and within 2 hours Marcela phoned me back and told me I was approved. She emailed me the documents to sign and told me if I completed and returned the documents before today the money would be in my bank the next business day, And it was there the next business day. I would like to personally thank Marcela Esutia for the chance to do business with her and First Midwest Bank.
