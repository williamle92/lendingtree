I retired at the end of December and went to Medellin on a three year Visa for Retirees. I was not planning on starting a business. I have a young psychologist friend here who I have known for four years. She is quite intelligent and has a gift for working with kids. She outlined a plan to work with kids here to teach them Social Emotional Learning through music and art. I decided that it would be better to limit the number of outside investors and better to retain most of the control of the business. Because I was out of the country, there were many challenges to even getting the approval for the loan. I had a credit score in the 800's, but no assets since I sold everything when I moved here. I maintain a permanent address in the US. Simple things like calling to confirm my information became very complicated. My loan specialist, Jasmine, was with me every step of the way with what seemed like an incredible amount of patience with my seemingly endless questions that basically had the theme \"how am I going to do this\".

With the other loan companies that I have used in the past for personal loans, it's never taken more than a couple of minutes to receive a decision. At Midwest, I was informed they were working on it, and to expect a phone call later in the day with their decision. That afternoon I got a phone call informing me that my application had been denied, even though the referral from Lending Tree made it seem like the chances of approval were high. I have a 750  credit score, so I asked why I had been denied. They explained it was because my debt-to-income ratio was too high; I was applying for a debt consolidation loan after all.

She emailed me the documents to sign and told me if I completed and returned the documents before today the money would be in my bank the next business day, And it was there the next business day.

{"title": "Christine Ruiz was wonderful", "content": "Getting my debt under control was extremely overwhelming as it seemed like the credit card companies were ruining my life. I had been worrying about my debt for so long that when I finally came to a breaking point I felt extremely hopeless, scared, and not sure where to turn. After some research and advice from family, I came to Lending Tree to get estimates from different banks to help find someone who could give me a debt consolidation loan. First Midwest Bank came up as the bank with the best rates for me and they reached out to me by email. Christine at First Midwest Bank was there for me from my beginning questions to the closing a few days later. Having one person helping through the entire process helped build trust and I felt like finally I wasn't alone against the credit cards companies. I'm extremely excited to be taking my life back and I feel lucky that the bank I was matched with was First Midwest.", "author": "Casper", "star_rating": "(5 of 5)", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in August 2019"},

The first time the girl who was helping me sent an email informing me of the denial at the very end of the day and then was out of the office so I had to call the phone number for them to tell me that it was denied due to them having me as Part-Time even though on the loan application, I put that I work Full-Time. Then was denied again and called in to find out it was due to them needing additional paperwork. Why they sent me a denial instead of just request the additional paperwork is beyond me. They also needed information on a credit card, yet could only give me the last 4 digits, so I took an entire lunch break online trying to figure out which card it is, only for them to tell me it's my dad's and not mine when I told them I could not find it.  I ended up having to submit a total of 10  documents to them via email and a full 3 weeks after submitting the original application, the loan was approved. Finally, I had stated via email TWICE that I wanted to be set up with auto-debit, yet no auto-debit for payments was set up.

{"title": "A truly great AND easy experience from start to finish", "content": "We were looking to pay off about 19K in total credit card debt between my wife and I's accounts and have only 1 monthly payment to make on the debt. I decided to go with the Lending Tree network as they are one of the oldest, most trusted online personal lenders around and have seemingly hundreds of online banking partners. We decided to apply with their partner First Midwest Bank, as they have almost 2000 reviews at close to  a 5 star average score, and very good sample rates as well. We were assigned loan offices Jasmine Vargas, and the entire process was simple and easy and took less than week to complete from start to finish, and that included playing some phone tag initially. I cannot recommend Lending Tree or their partner First Midwest any higher, and would like to let anyone considering an online personal loan know that First Midwest is definitely the way to go. If you can, please request to deal with Jasmine Vargas as she is OUTSTANDING to work with.", "author": "Eric", "star_rating": "(5 of 5)", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in July 2019"},

I can honestly say that I did not encounter ANY of the issues that I expected.  Patrick Offerman, the bank representative that I worked with was very patient and informed.  He responded to my e-mails and phone calls in a timely manner.  The fixed rate that I was offered was GREAT.  The fixed rate that 1st Midwest approved me for is more that 10% less than one of  my credit card which saves me hundreds of dollars over the life of the loan. They have really good re-payment plans also.  This loan took a lot of weight off of me, I felt wonderful after receiving the approval, the rate and monthly payment amount.  This loan gave me back a sense of control over my finances.  I am a walking advertisement for 1st Midwest and would highly recommend them to my family, my friends or anyone who is seeking release from the burden(s) of credit card debt with their ever increasing rates or other expenses that may be encountered in life\u2019s unpredictable circumstances.
