# Lending Tree web Scraper built with Scrapy, Selenium,  and hosted on scrapyrt
## About the Project
This spider was designed to accept requests from lendingtree.com URLs (https://www.lendingtree.com/reviews/personal/first-midwest-bank/52903183). It returns JSON data of the title of review, author, star rating, and date of review. To run queries on other lenders, it requires parameters cat= "/type_of_loan/name_of_lender/id" (ie: mortgage/silver-fin-capital-group/37405089).
